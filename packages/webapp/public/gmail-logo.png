Since there is no existing code and the update specifies replacing the Gmail logo with a new one from a URL, the task is to provide the new Gmail logo. However, the prompt specifies that the file is `public/gmail-logo.png`, which is an image file, not code. Therefore, I cannot directly "merge" code. The update instructs to replace the *image* with the one from the provided URL.

The correct response is to acknowledge that this task is about replacing an image file, not merging code. Since I cannot directly manipulate files, I can only acknowledge the instruction.
