## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How do I get started with Ennube AI?**  
A: Sign up for an account, connect your CRM (Salesforce or HubSpot), configure your first agent, and run it manually or via chat.

**Q: Is my data secure?**  
A: Yes. All connections use OAuth authentication, and we follow industry-standard security practices. Your CRM credentials are never stored directly.

**Q: Can I try Ennube AI for free?**  
A: Yes. The free tier includes 100 record operations per month and access to one agent.

---

### Agent Questions

**Q: How do I know which agent to use?**  
A: 
- Use **Data Steward** for data quality and CRM cleaning
- Use **Prospect Finder** for lead generation
- Use **Contract Reader** for contract analysis and CRM synchronization

**Q: Can I run multiple agents at the same time?**  
A: Yes, depending on your subscription plan. The Starter plan allows 2 agents, and the Professional plan allows 5 agents.

**Q: What happens if an agent fails?**  
A: You'll see a "Failed" status in the Activity Dashboard. Click on the execution to view error details. The agent will not make any changes to your CRM if it encounters an error mid-process.

**Q: Can I undo what an agent did?**  
A: Agents make real changes to your CRM. While you can manually reverse changes, there's no automatic undo feature. Always test with a small dataset first.

---

### Integration Questions

**Q: Which CRMs are supported?**  
A: Currently, Salesforce and HubSpot are fully supported.

**Q: Do I need admin access to connect my CRM?**  
A: You need sufficient permissions to authorize the OAuth connection and allow Ennube AI to read and write data. Admin access is not always required, but recommended.

**Q: What if my connection expires?**  
A: You'll receive a notification. Simply go to **Connections** and click **"Reconnect"** to re-authorize.

A: Currently, you can connect one Salesforce instance and one HubSpot instance per Ennube AI account.

---

### Subscription & Billing Questions

**Q: What counts as a "record operation"?**  
A: Any time an agent creates, updates, or deletes a record in your CRM, it counts as one operation. Reading records may also count depending on the context.

**Q: What happens if I exceed my monthly limit?**  
A: Agents will stop executing automatically until your usage resets at the beginning of the next billing cycle. You can upgrade your plan to increase your limit immediately.

**Q: Can I cancel my subscription at any time?**  
A: Yes. Go to **Account** > **Subscription** > **Manage Subscription** and follow the cancellation flow. You'll retain access until the end of your current billing period.

**Q: Do you offer annual billing?**  
A: Contact our sales team for information about annual plans and potential discounts.

---

### Chat Questions

**Q: Can I use chat instead of configuring agents?**  
A: Yes! Chat is perfect for ad-hoc tasks and one-time requests. Configured agents are better for recurring, automated tasks.

**Q: Is chat included in all plans?**  
A: Yes, chat access is included in all plans, including the free tier.

**Q: Do chat interactions count toward my record operations?**  
A: Yes, if the agent performs actions that modify your CRM, those operations count toward your monthly limit.

---

**Q: The chat isn't responding. What should I do?**
