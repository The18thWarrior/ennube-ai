Act as a senior full-stack developer. I am the lead architect.

Your task is to generate a high-level implementation plan for the following change request. The plan should be broken down into logical components (e.g., Backend API, Frontend UI, Database, etc.) and list the primary files/modules that will likely be created or modified.

**1. Feature / User Story:**
As a [user type], I want to [perform some action] so that [I can achieve some goal].
* **Epic/Initiative:** (Optional) [e.g., Q3-2025 User Profile Overhaul]

**2. Core Functional Requirements:**
* [List 2-5 critical, non-negotiable requirements. Focus on WHAT, not HOW.]
* [Example: Users must be able to upload a `.jpg` or `.png` file under 5MB.]
* [Example: The system must store the file and associate it with the user's record.]
* [Example: The user's new avatar must be displayed in the site header.]

**3. Key Components & Context:**
* **Affected Areas:** [List the parts of the app this touches. e.g., User Dashboard, API v2, PostgreSQL DB]
* **Tech Stack Context:** [Provide critical stack info if not obvious. e.g., React (Next.js), Node.js (Fastify), TypeORM, AWS S3 for storage]
* **Existing Code:** (Optional) [Point to a key existing function or component the agent should be aware of. e.g., "Leverage the existing `useUser()` hook for auth context."]

**4. Constraints & Out-of-Scope:**
* **Constraints:** [Hard rules the agent must follow. e.g., "Must use the existing `ImageUploader` component.", "No new npm packages may be added."]
* **Out-of-Scope:** [What NOT to do. e.g., "Do not implement image cropping in this phase.", "This does not include changes to the mobile app."]
