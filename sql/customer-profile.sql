/**
 * OVERVIEW
 *
 * - Purpose: Stores customer profile attributes for segmentation, targeting, and analytics.
 * - Assumptions: Arrays (industries, products, regions, channels, social media) stored as JSONB for flexibility.
 * - Edge Cases: Large arrays, missing optional fields, future schema changes.
 * - How it fits: Used by integrations, analytics, and reporting modules for account strategy.
 * - Future Improvements: Normalize arrays into separate tables for scalability if needed.
